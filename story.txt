I was walking to class on a cold and stormy fall day when all of a sudden a bear jumped out the bush and attacked me. I was frightened by the bear and so I started to run away as fast as I could. During my escaped I fell and started to roll uncontrollably down bascom hill and was screaming the whole way down. This all was because they accidently let a bear loose on campus. I know I should've stayed in bed today. 

The bear had been brought to campus by the UW Madison Grizzly Bear Appreciation Club for International Bring A Deadly Wild Animal to School Day 2019.  I finally rolled to the bottom of Bascom Hill covered in dirt and gravel while the bear began sniffing Abe's statue.  The hill was seemingly empty of other students and because of this I could hear the bear roaring at the bottom of the hill.

Using my binoculars that I always carry with me, I saw someone jump out of a second story window in Bascom Hall and they started to fight the bear in hand-to-hand combat. Once I got a good look at them, I realized it was UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank. She performed some intense martial arts moves on the huge Grizzly and before the bear even had a chance to defend itself, Chancellor Blank had bested it.
