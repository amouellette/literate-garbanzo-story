I was walking to class on a cold and stormy fall day when all of a sudden a bear jumped out the bush and attacked me. I was frightened by the bear and so I started to run away as fast as I could. During my escaped I fell and started to roll uncontrollably down bascom hill and was screaming the whole way down. This all was because they accidently let a bear loose on campus. I know I should've stayed in bed today.
