I was walking to class on a cold and stormy fall day when all of a sudden a bear jumped out the bush and attacked me. I was frightened by the bear and so I started to run away as fast as I could. During my escaped I fell and started to roll uncontrollably down bascom hill and was screaming the whole way down. This all was because they accidently let a bear loose on campus. I know I should've stayed in bed today. 

The bear had been brought to campus by the UW Madison Grizzly Bear Appreciation Club for International Bring A Deadly Wild Animal to School Day 2019.  I finally rolled to the bottom of Bascom Hill covered in dirt and gravel while the bear began sniffing Abe's statue.  The hill was seemingly empty of other students and because of this I could hear the bear roaring at the bottom of the hill.
